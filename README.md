ðŸš— Car Price Prediction with Regression Models

This project demonstrates how to predict car prices using a dataset of automobile features. It implements and compares several regression models:
- Simple Linear Regression (e.g., highway-mpg vs. price)
- Multiple Linear Regression (using combinations of features)
- Polynomial Regression (to capture non-linear relationships)
- Scikit-learn Pipelines (for streamlining preprocessing like scaling and feature transformation)

The analysis includes data loading, model fitting, prediction, visualization of relationships (scatter plots, residual plots, distribution plots), and model performance evaluation using R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
